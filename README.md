Plastic SCM plugin for Unreal Engine
------------------------------------

[![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/PlasticSCM/UE4PlasticPlugin.svg)](https://github.com/PlasticSCM/UE4PlasticPlugin/releases)
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/SRombauts/UE4PlasticPlugin](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/UE4PlasticPlugin)

This is the **official [Plastic SCM](https://www.plasticscm.com/) Source Control Provider plugin for Unreal Engine 4 & 5** (UE 4.11 to 4.27, and UE 5.0).
An old version of it has been integrated in Unreal Engine 4.24 and is shipping with it since then (equivalent to 1.4.6+).
But if you have a project of a certain size, chances are you need to upgrade manually to a version we provide from Github
in order to benefit of all the performance improvements we have made since then.
See the Status section bellow for more details.

It is not intended to replace [Plastic SCM GUI](https://www.plasticscm.com/documentation/gui/plastic-scm-version-control-gui-guide)
or [command line interface "cm"](https://www.plasticscm.com/documentation/cli/plastic-scm-version-control-cli-guide).
It is a complementary tool improving efficiency in your daily workflow with assets in Editor.

It automates tracking of assets, brings common SCM tasks inside the Editor, and provides visual diffing of Blueprints.
It also helps importing an existing Unreal Project into source control, with appropriate *ignore.conf* file.
Since Unreal does not manage C++ source code, but only assets, the plugin is especially useful for GDs and artists.

## User Guide

### Plugin Setup

#### Unreal default version of the plugin

An old version of this PlasticSCM plugin has now been integrated in Unreal Engine and is shipping with it since UE4.24 and UE5.0.

Why: This is the easiest way to get started with Plastic SCM in Unreal Engine, but it will always be lagging behind the latest release here.

#### Manual installation from the latest version here

Why: if you want the latest features, performance improvements and bug fixes that are missing from Unreal integrated plugin.

 1. Download the [latest binary release UE4PlasticPlugin-x.x.x.zip](https://github.com/PlasticSCM/UE4PlasticPlugin/releases) targeting your UE4 version.
 2. Either:
     1. Unzip the content of the ZIP directly at the root of your project folder.
        This creates a "Plugins/UE4PlasticPlugin/" subdirectory into your project.
        This is the way to go to use Plastic SCM only on a specific project.
     2. Unzip the content of the ZIP in the Engine/ directory of UE4.x directly for all your projects
        (for instance "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\4.25\Engine\")
        This creates a "UE4PlasticPlugin" folder into the "Plugins/" subdirectory.
        This is the way to enable Plastic SCM for all Unreal Engine projects.
 3. Then, launch you Unreal project, click on the Source Control icon "Connect to Source", select "Plastic SCM".

#### How to build from sources

Why: If your project is already a C++ project, you only have to re-generate Visual Studio project files (step 4 bellow) and the plugin will get rebuild the next time you compile your project.

Else, if you want to rebuild the plugin for a Blueprint project:

 0. You need Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 with C++ language support (free Community Edition is fine).
 1. Launch the Unreal Engine Editor, create a new C++ **Basic Code** Project (No Starter Content), for instance UnrealPlasticSCM. This should launch Visual Studio, build the game project, and open it into the Editor.
 2. Close the Editor, then using the file explorer, create a new **Plugins** directory at the root of your project.
 3. Clone the source code of the plugin into this _Plugins_ directory (for instance _Plugins\UE4PlasticPlugin_).
 4. Right-click on your project's **.uproject** file, **Generate Visual Studio project files**.
 5. In Visual Studio, **Reload All** and **Build Solution** in **Development Editor** mode. That's it, the plugin is built (resulting dlls are located in _Plugins\UE4PlasticPlugin\Binaries\Win64_).

To release the plugin, zip the _Plugins_ folder. But before that, remove the _Intermediate_, _Screenshots_ and _.git_ folders, and also the big *.pdb files in _Plugins\UE4PlasticPlugin\Binaries\Win64_.

### Project Setup

Start by [saving your connection credentials with the Plastic SCM GUI](#save-connection-credentials)

#### Enable Source Control

Launch you Unreal project, look at the Source Control menu at the bottom-right
![Source Control Connect](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-SourceControlDisabled.png)

Launch you Unreal project, click on the Source Control icon "Connect to Source"
![Source Control Connect](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-ConnectToSourceControl.png)

Then select "Plastic SCM" plugin
![Source Control Connect - Select Provider](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-SelectProvider.png)

#### Create a new workspace & repository directly from Unreal

Source Control Login window, to create a new workspace/a new repository, click on "Initialize workspace" (example of a cloud repository):
![Source Control Login window - create a new workspace on cloud](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-CreateWorkspaceCloud.png)

Or on a server running on premise, using ip:port:
![Source Control Login window - create a new workspace on localhost](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-CreateWorkspaceOnPremise.png)

This creates an appropriate ignore.conf file, add all relevant files to source control (.uproject, Config & Content subdirectories)
and can also do the initial commit automatically at the end.

Wait for this to succeed before accepting source control settings to not lock the UI & mess with the initialization!
![Source Control Login window - checking files in source control](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-CheckinInProgress.png)

#### Source Control settings

![Source Control Settings](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-SourceControlSettings.png)

Source control settings can be changed using the Source Control menu,
and are saved locally in `Saved\Config\WindowsEditor\SourceControlSettings.ini`.

##### Sharing settings

In order to share this with the team, copy and rename this file into `Config\DefaultSourceControlSettings.ini`,
add it to source control and submit it.

The minimal useful setting would be selecting the proper provider,
but it can be useful to set a few settings if different than the defaults:

```ini
[SourceControl.SourceControlSettings]
Provider=Plastic SCM

[PlasticSourceControl.PlasticSourceControlSettings]
BinaryPath=cm
UpdateStatusAtStartup=False
UpdateStatusOtherBranches=True
EnableVerboseLogs=False
```

#### Project Settings

The plugin allows you to configure project-related settings.

![Project Settings](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-ProjectSettings.png)

There are 3 settings available at the moment:

 - **User Name to Display Name**
   - For each entry in this dictionary, the Editor will replace the user name in the key with the display value you specify.
 - **Hide Email Domain in Username**
   - This setting toggles the visibility of domain names in user names, if the user name is an email.
 - **Prompt for Checkout on Change**
   - Unchecking this setting will make the Editor consider all files as already checked out. In that case, you won't get
     any notifications when you modify assets, and the "Checkout Assets" dialog won't show when you save those changes.
     This mimics how Git works, i.e. allowing the user to perform changes without worrying about checking out items.
	 Note: Changelists don't currently support locally changed assets (ie not checked-out)

##### View Changelists

List of Changelists and checked-out files they contain:
![Changelist Window](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-Changelists.png)

#### Redirectors

When Source Control is enabled Unreal creates a redirector whenever an asset is renamed or moved,
so that other developers relying on it's old name / location can still work with other assets referencing it.

This means, you end up with two files that you have to submit, even if by default they don't show up in the Content Browser.

You can show them in the Content Browser using a dedicated filter:
![Source Control - Show Redirectors](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-ShowRedirectors.png)

You can also delete them recursively using the context menu "Fix Up Redirectors in Folder":
![Source Control - Show Redirectors](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-FixUpRedirectorsInFolder.png)

#### Branches support

If you are making use of multiple branches, either for releases and patches, or for tasks or features,
you can enable an option to check for changes in all other branches.

Tooltip in the Content Browser when an asset is already checked-out somewhere else:
![Asset checked-out by someone else](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-CheckedOutOther-Tooltip.png)

![Warning on modification for an asset modified in another branch](Screenshots/UEPlasticPlugin-BranchModification-WarningOnModification.png)

#### Merge conflicts on Blueprints

In case you ever use branches with binary assets without relying on exclusive checkouts (file locks) ((see Workflows below)[#workflows])
you will encounter case of merge conflicts on binary assets.
You have to trigger the resolve in the Plastic SCM GUI, but then skip it without saving changes in order to let the Editor presents you with a visual diff.

#### Workflows

##### Mainline

The most common workflow with Unreal Engine binary assets is the one taught by Perforce:
It relies mostly on one main branch (stream) for everyone with [exclusive checkouts (locks) for the whole Content/ subdirectory](#configure-locks-for-unreal-assets-exclusive-checkout),
in order to prevent merge conflicts on a uasset or a umap file.

This typical workflow would work the best with **the workspace in partial mode** configured using Gluon GUI.
The reason is that a partial workspace enables you to checkin assets without the need to update the workspace before.

1. update the workspace (get latest) using Gluon GUI, with the Unreal Editor closed (since the Editor is locking assets, but also .exe & .dll files that might be in source control)
2. start the Editor, make modifications and checkout assets
3. then checkin (submit) the assets, either from withing the Editor, or from the GUI after closing the Editor (the benefit of closing is you ensure that everything is saved)
4. when needed, close the Editor and update the workspace again

If you try to use a full workspace (with Plastic SCM GUI instead of Gluon) you will often need to update the workspace before being able to checkin.

##### Task branches

Handling of binary assets works best in only one branch (regardless of the source control used)
since they cannot be merged, and since they increase the cost (time/bandwidth) of switching between branches.

But with Plastic SCM you can use branches that are easy and cheap to create and merge:
using them for code will enable you to leverage the built-in code review on these branches.

Note that some studios also use task branches for assets, and include them in their code reviews.
Plastic SCM locks extend to all branches, preventing two people from working at the same time on the same assets regardless of the branch they are one.
The Plastic plugin also offer [some branch support to warn users if an asset has been changed in another branch](#branches-support).

To use branches, you would need to also close the Editor before switching from a branch to another, and before merging a branch into another:

1. create a child branch from main using Plastic GUI
2. switch to it, updating the workspace, with the Unreal Editor closed
3. start the Editor, make modifications and checkout assets
4. then checkin the assets (remember to save everything, or close the Editor to make sure of it)
5. close the Editor
6. create a code review from the branch
7. create a new task branch from main or go back to main to merge branches

The plugin also leverages the [visual diff merge conflicts resolution tool from the Editor](#merge-conflicts-on-blueprints) but this is a pain and isn't working as expected currently (as of 1.5.0 & UE5.0)

### Plastic SCM Setup

#### Save connection credentials

The plugin works with the command line interface "cm" that currently requires your credentials to be stored.
Use the Plastic SCM or Gluon GUI to enter and save your credentials before enabling Plastic SCM in Unreal.

#### Configure Locks for Unreal Assets (exclusive checkout)

[Administrator guide - Chapter 7: Configuring exclusive checkout (Lock)](https://www.plasticscm.com/documentation/administration/plastic-scm-version-control-administrator-guide#Chapter7:Configuringexclusivecheckout(Lock))

Binary assets should be locked for exclusive access to avoid merge conflicts.

To lock all assets on the whole `Content` directory, you need to put a `lock.conf` in your server directory (for instance `C:\Program Files\PlasticSCM5\server`) with this content:

    rep:<repname> [lockserver:[<server>:<port>]]
    /Content

For instance the more generic one would be:

    rep:*
    /Content

or to be more specific to one repository:

    rep:UE4PlasticPluginDev lockserver:localhost:8087
    *.uasset
    *.umap

On Plastic Cloud, you can just setup lock rules like that:

    /Content

#### Configure Visual Diff of Blueprints from Plastic SCM GUI

In "Preferences -> Diff tools" add a new config for uasset and move it up **before** the existing `$binary` one:
![Diff tools](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-GUIDiffTools.png)

The command line needs the quoted path to the UE4Editor.exe, the quoted patch to your ".uproject" file, -diff, than the source & destination files variables also quoted

    "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.27\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" "C:\wkspaces\MyProject\MyProject.uproject" -diff "@sourcefile" "@destinationfile"

or for Unreal Engine 5:

    "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.0\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe" "C:\wkspaces\MyProject\MyProject.uproject" -diff "@sourcefile" "@destinationfile"
